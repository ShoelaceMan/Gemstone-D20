# Gemstone D20
Gemstone D20 is a very simple app that rolls dice for tabletop RPG's, like Dungeons and Dragons.

# Usage
Using Gemstone D20 is very easy, you run the program, and are greeted with an interface not unlike a bash terminal. You can browse history with the up/down arrow keys, and edit text normally with backspace and usual keys.

To roll dice, you just have to learn an easy syntax, as follows:
`[# of dice]"d"[Type of dice](+-)[Modifier]`

Now, number of dice, and modifier are optional, here are some examples:
`2d20` will roll 2 20 sided dice, add up the total, and print the output.
`3d6+4` will roll 3 6 sided dice, add up the total, add 4 to the total, then print.
`d4` will roll a 4 sided die.
and so on.

# Plans
I'm very new to tabletop RPG's, so I'm not exactly sure what to put next specifically, but a short list is as follows:
* A timer with titles
* A counter for HP, MP, whatever
* A universal slot counter
